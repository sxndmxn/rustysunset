# Easing function for temperature transitions:
#   linear    - constant rate, no smoothing
#   ease_in   - starts slow, accelerates (quadratic)
#   ease_out  - starts fast, decelerates (quadratic)
#   ease_in_out - slow at both ends (quadratic)
#   sine      - gentle S-curve using cosine, natural feel
#   smooth    - Hermite smoothstep (3t^2 - 2t^3), best default
#   smoother  - Perlin smootherstep (6t^5 - 15t^4 + 10t^3), ultra-smooth
#   cubic_bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2) - custom curve, e.g. "cubic_bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0)"
